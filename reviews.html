                            Jay was very helpful as my wife and I became the GC. He was very insightful as to decisions
                            and
                            implications as we worked through timelines and schedule impacts. He brought many
                            suggestions
                            that helped us and was able to re-use some components - saving us some dollars. Jay’s team
                            was
                            very efficient and always cleaned up the workspace after their daily activities. We’ve

                            Jay came in at a time of need and felt our pain for our bathroom situation, a 5-month long
                            headache. He made our bathroom a goal to have completed before the new year, and if it
                            wasn't
                            for him, we wouldn't have a completed bathroom. But thanks to Jay, our bathroom will be
                            completed before the end of the year! Jay was willing to work with our budget and our
                            schedule.
                            He was also willing to let us finish the cosmetic things that we wanted to finish and did
                            not
                            push us to have him finish them for us. But in the end, we will be bringing him back to
                            finish
                            some cosmetic details. Jay is very thorough in his work and communicates with you every step
                            of
                            the way! Jay is very professional, and him and his team clean up after themselves as well!

                            Jay was straightforward to work with. He worked for me on several home improvement projects
                            and
                            understood my vision, making great suggestions that, without cutting corners, saved me money
                            in
                            the end. He never left the work area a mess. I appreciated his respect for our home and
                            time. I
                            highly recommend him for any of your construction needs.
