                                    Jay was very professional from the start. Stuck to the quote he gave us. Showed up
                                    on time and completed the project in the amount of time he estimated. Would highly
                                    recommend him to anyone. We will hire him for our future projects. Thanks Jay! Great
                                    job to you and your partner that worked with you! Sincerely, Tom & Marie

                                    Jay was very helpful as my wife and I became the GC. He was very insightful as to
                                    decisions and implications as we worked through timelines and schedule impacts. He
                                    brought many suggestions that helped us and was able to re-use some components -
                                    saving us some dollars. Jay’s team was very efficient and always cleaned up the
                                    workspace after their daily activities. We’ve already passed on his card to our
                                    designer and have told friends about his work.
