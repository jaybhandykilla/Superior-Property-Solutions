Jay’s team was very efficient and always cleaned up the workspace after their daily activities. We’ve already passed on his card to our designer and have told friends about his work.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Jay came in at a time of need and felt our pain for our bathroom situation, a 5-month long headache. He made our bathroom a goal to have completed before the new year, and if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have a completed bathroom. But thanks to Jay, our bathroom will be completed before the end of the year! Jay was willing to work with our budget and our schedule. He was also willing to let us finish the cosmetic things that we wanted to finish and did not push us to have him finish them for us. But in the end, we will be bringing him back to finish some cosmetic details. Jay is very thorough in his work and communicates with you every step of the way! Jay is very professional, and him and his team clean up after themselves as well!</p>
